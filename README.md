# Python-Projects
Hi, my name is Okan Kaynak, and this repository contains all my projects that i have been working on within my journey of learning Python.

1. The first project that I created was the 'Number Guessing Game' which requires the user to guess the number that is randomly selected within a range. There are different levels to the game which increase in difficulty as the levels increase. There is a good use of data validation within my code to ensure the data input is valid and in the correct format. 


2. The 'Simple Calculator' is another project I have completed which is used for basic calculations. The valid operators that can be used are '+', '-', '*', '/'. There is a good use of error handling for every possible user input with the user of try and excepts and while loops. When the program outputs the total result of the calculation, the user is offered the option to make another calculation or exit the program.
